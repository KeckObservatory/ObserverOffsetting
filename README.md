# ObserverOffsetting
Tool for Keck observers to offset the telescope in any frame of reference they should need.

This repository contains different tools for observers to offset the telescope during the night.
There are a couple ways to use these tools:

# Manually
All of the scripts in OffsetLib can be ran independently.

# Interactive Program
moveTel.py is an interactive terminal program that can be started at the beginning of the night 
and keep running the whole night.  

# Future: Gui
Eventually an interactive gui should be created for this.
